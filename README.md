# Erlang-Markov-Chain

* Markov chain wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
* Priming the Markov chain:
  * Parse out words
  * Iterate over words, and create an association between a word and the word following it
* Generating the Markov chain:
  * Given a word, we want to pick from the next word the probability of occurrence
  * Keep picking the words until we reach the number of words to generate
